1. You are given a positive number n. 
2. You are required to print the counting from n to 1.
3. You are required to not use any loops. Complete the body of print Decreasing function to achieve it.

Note -> The online judge can't force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is. Write recursive and not iterative logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.

As in case of increasing the f(n-1) was being called first and then the printling was done in this case the priting will be performed first the n call f(n-1) will b ecalled

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // write your code here
        Scanner scn=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=scn.nextInt();
        printDecreasing(n);
    }

    public static void printDecreasing(int n){
        if(n==0)
        return;
        
        System.out.println(n);
        printDecreasing(n-1);
        
        
        
    }

}
